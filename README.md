## Technical Details

The game uses a simple pixel-based collision detection system and implements basic physics for character movement. The game world is represented as a 2D array of tiles, with each tile having properties like solidity and color.

The rendering system uses a camera that follows the player character, allowing for a scrolling world that's larger than the visible canvas.
